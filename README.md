The HR Employee Distribution Report project aims to address critical workforce management challenges faced by organizations. It begins by integrating seamlessly with the existing Human Resources Information System (HRIS) to ensure real-time data accuracy. The system must offer a customizable user interface that empowers users to adapt reporting parameters to their specific organizational structures and reporting needs. Key objectives include providing insights into gender and race/ethnicity distribution trends among employees, visualizing the age demographics of the workforce, and distinguishing between headquarters and remote locations, possibly by state or region. Furthermore, the system should calculate average employment length for terminated employees and offer tenure distribution analysis by department. Additionally, users should be able to explore job title distribution and analyze gender disparities across departments and job roles. Historical trends in employee count based on hire and termination dates, with customizable timeframes, are essential for understanding workforce changes over time.
